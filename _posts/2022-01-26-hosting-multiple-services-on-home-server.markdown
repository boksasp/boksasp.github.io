The purpose of this project is to verify that I can host multiple web sites/services on the same machine,
 where each site/service has a unique domain name.

I don't want to add host file entries for all my services on all my devices, so it became obvious I needed
 a local DNS server where I could control DNS records myself. I have an old Raspberry Pi (Model B, 512MB RAM)
 which I installed [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) on. 

For serving the different services, I decided to use the Nginx web server. By adding a new server block for each service,
 I'm able to forward requests to specific domains to a specific \<address\>:\<port\> with `proxy_pass`. If your using the Apache web server,
 the same can be achieved by using virtual hosts.

I tested the whole thing with two "hello-world" type node apps running on different ports.

Summary:  
- **Pi-hole** for local DNS resolution
- **Nginx** as web server with proxy pass to multiple services running on the same machine
- **NodeJS apps** for having content to access when testing

## Details

### Pi-hole
I'm using a default installation of Pi-hole. I turned all the privacy settings to the strictest setting,
 as I don't want to monitor all my family's network activities (Settings -> Privacy -> Anonymous mode).

The only other change I did to Pi-hole was to add two local DNS records.

1. test1.home -> 192.168.86.213
2. test2.home -> 192.168.86.213

**Main router DNS**  
For all the devices on my home network to go through Pi-hole, I set the primary DNS on my Google Wifi router
 to my Raspberry Pi address.

I'm so impressed by the Raspberry Pi handling all that traffic without noticably slowing down the network ü§©

### Nginx
I ran the web server on my Windows desktop computer for testing purposes.  
Standard installation of Nginx for Windows. It doesn't run as a service, so I have to start it through the nginx executable provided with the install.

I added a server block for each of the node apps I was to run on the server:

```conf
# Add one for each app
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name test1.home; # or test2.home

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3031; # or :3032
    }
}

```

I ended up using port `8080` because I had some issues using port `80` without changing the default route of Nginx. It kept giving me the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

I couldn't be assed digging any deeper, so I just changed to `8080`.

### Node apps
I started up two node apps just so I could have something to test against.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const host = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3031; // change port for the other node app

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello test 1!'); // change number for the other node app
});

server.listen(port, host, () => {
   console.log('Web server running at http://%s:%s',host,port );
});
```

# Notes

‚ùó **Troubleshooting notes on Local DNS Records**  
The first DNS record I tried was test1.local. It worked like a charm when I was testing it from my Windows computer, where the apps where running.

But when testing how it resolved over the network, I used my MacBook. Turns out Mac OS doesn't use the network assigned DNS server when
 resolving `*.local` domains, so I just got a DNS error. It turns out Apple devices
 use `.local` for `bonjour`, an implementation of zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) used for local network service discovery and **name resolution**.

Bad idea to use that as a custom local domain name with a lot of Apple devices...

Zeroconf isn't an Apple-only technology, so it's a bad idea for anyone.
